## How it works

This project implements an 8-bit programmable counter.

## How to test

The bidirectional pins are used to load the counter with an 8-bit value. Input pins 0, 1, and 2 are used to enable synchronous load, enable counting (incrementing), and enable output (0 simulates high Z) respectively. The output pins represents the value stored in the counter.

## External hardware

None.
